Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms.

Steps:
1. Start from the second element, compare it with elements before it.
2. Move all elements greater than the key to one position ahead.
3. Insert the key at its correct position.
4. Repeat for all elements.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Stable: Yes
