Quick Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot.

Steps:
1. Choose a pivot element.
2. Partition the array so that elements less than the pivot are on the left, and greater are on the right.
3. Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) (average)
Space Complexity: O(log n)
