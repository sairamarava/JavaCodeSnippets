Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the array into a sorted and unsorted part. 
It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the
end of the sorted part.

Steps:
1. Find the minimum element in the unsorted array.
2. Swap it with the first unsorted element.
3. Move the boundary of the sorted part one step forward.
4. Repeat until the array is sorted.
