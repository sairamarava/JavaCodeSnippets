Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, 
compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
The process is repeated until the list is sorted.

Steps:
1. Compare each pair of adjacent items and swap them if they are in the wrong order.
2. After each pass, the largest element moves to its correct position.
3. Repeat the process for all elements except the last sorted ones.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
