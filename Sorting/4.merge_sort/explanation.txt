Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges them back together.

Steps:
1. Divide the array into two halves.
2. Recursively sort each half.
3. Merge the sorted halves.

Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
Stable: Yes
